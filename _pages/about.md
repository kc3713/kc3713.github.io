## Personal Bio
I am a graduate student in the Quantitative Methods in Social Science (QMSS) program at Columbia University, where I focus on applying advanced statistical and machine learning techniques to complex social science problems. My background in data analysis and interdisciplinary research allows me to explore the intersection of computational methods, policy, and social impact.



## Research Interests
- Machine Learning for Social Science – Applying predictive modeling, NLP, and statistical learning to analyze social phenomena.
- Climate Risk and Disaster Prediction – Using large-scale environmental data and AI to enhance disaster preparedness.
- Ethical AI and Algorithmic Bias – Investigating fairness, transparency, and accountability in machine learning models used in policy and decision-making.

## QMSS Practicum Project
As part of the QMSS Practicum in Data Analysis, I am collaborating with Alt Surya Inc. to develop a predictive software system for early warning of cloudbursts in urban areas. This project involves:
- Building a Machine Learning Model: Developing statistical and deep learning approaches to predict cloudburst events within a 6-hour window.
- Data Engineering & Analysis: Working with large-scale climate datasets, including NOAA and FEMA repositories, to refine prediction accuracy.
- Interdisciplinary Collaboration: Partnering with domain experts in climate science and industry mentors to bridge data-driven insights with real-world applications.
