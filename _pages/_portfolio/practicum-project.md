## Project Overview
As part of the QMSS Practicum in Data Analysis, this project focuses on developing a machine learning-based predictive system to forecast cloudbursts in urban areas. Sponsored by Alt Surya Inc., the goal is to enhance disaster preparedness by providing an early warning system capable of predicting cloudburst events within a 6-hour window.

The project involves:
- Analyzing large-scale climate datasets (e.g., NOAA, FEMA) to identify key predictive features.
- Building and validating predictive models, comparing traditional statistical methods with modern deep learning approaches.
- Developing an interactive visualization dashboard to communicate model outputs effectively.

## Role & Responsibilities
- Data Scientist: Preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling using advanced machine learning techniques.
- Model Development & Validation: Implementing statistical and deep learning models to improve cloudburst prediction accuracy.
- Collaborative Research & Documentation: Working with industry mentors to refine methodologies and document findings.

## Technologies Used
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, xarray)
- Machine Learning (time series analysis, ARIMA, LLM-based prediction models)
- GitHub (version control, collaborative coding)
- Data Visualization (Plotly, Folium)
- Cloud-Based Computing (Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks)
